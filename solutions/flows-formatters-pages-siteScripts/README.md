# Session: BRK3080 - Create 'No code' solutions with SharePoint and Flow.

## What is this session about?

This Ignite session is for SharePoint 'makers'. We will show you all the steps we took to create a full-fledged application. We picked an easy to understand scenario that covers multiple low-code extensibility mechanisms. The scenario incorporates business logic (using Flows), and no-code-custom-UI to make your application look great and responsive on all screen sizes. We will also walk you through a number of insider tips and tricks to get the most out of this session.

## So, what are we going to make?
We are going to make a typical classroom/corporate-learning application.

1. [We'll use SharePoint lists and libraries to store data.](#Lists)
2. [We'll take advantage of Microsoft Flows to apply the necessary business logic.](#Flows)
3. [We'll use the newly released view formatters on lists to completely customize the UX of the application so that it looks delightful and responsive on all screen sizes.](#ViewFormatters)
4. [We'll use modern pages, web-parts, and dynamic web-part connections to create the home page and other tailor-made experiences for drill-in pages.](#Pages)
5. [And finally, we'll show you how to package up the application (Lists, Libraries, Flows, custom-ux etc.) using site scripts.](#SiteScripts)
6. [So that you can stamp out a new "classroom application" every time a site is created using the new hub-site join site script action.](#Packaging)
